DANS BagIt Profile v1.0.0
=========================

Introduction
------------

### Version

* Document version: 1.0.0
* Publication date: <!-- TODO -->

### Status

* DRAFT

### Scope

This document specifies what constitutes an acceptable DANS bag. This includes all the requirements for a bag to be
successfully processed by the ingest workflow. What is acceptable as a DEPOSIT bag is sometimes not exactly the same as what
is acceptable as a MIGRATION bag. Where these are different, this is documented.

Version 1.0.0 covers the requirements used by the DANS Data Stations. In this context a DEPOSIT is the bag as it is
submitted by the client and a MIGRATION bag is a package that is migrated from DANS EASY to the Data Station.

### Overview and conventions

#### Key words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "
OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

The key word "SHOULD" is also used to specify requirements that are impossible or impractical to check by the archival
organization (i.e. DANS). The client should do its best to meet these requirements, but not rely on their being
validated by the archival organization.

#### Subdivisions

The requirements are subdivided into the following sections:

* BagIt-related requirements - requirements that refer back to the BagIt specifications
* Structural requirements - requirements regarding the directories and files in the bag
* Metadata requirements - requirements regarding the metadata files included in the bag
* Dataset update requirements - requirements regarding the metadata that records how subsequent versions of a dataset 
  can represent the history of a dataset 

The sections are numbered and may have numbered subsections. The requirements themselves are stated as numbered rules.
To uniquely identify a specific rule, use the notation `<section-nr>[.<subsection-nr>].<rule-nr>`, e.g., 2.3.4 for the
fourth rule in subsection 3 of section 2.


#### MIGRATION vs DEPOSIT

Rules that only apply to MIGRATION bags or DEPOSIT bags are annotated with the comments "**(MIGRATION)**" and "**(DEPOSIT)**"
respectively. All other rules apply to MIGRATION and DEPOSIT bags alike.

#### Stand-alone vs with-versions-context validation

There are two levels of validation:

* **stand-alone**: this includes the validation steps that can be performed without taking into account any data outside
  the bag, in particular possible previous versions of the deposit. This means that only the rules in sections 1-3
  are checked in this level.
* **with-versions-context**: this includes all the checks done in stand-alone validation plus checks that involve the
  dataset versions that the bag is (to be) part of. This means all the rules in this document are checked.

Stand-alone validation can be useful when you do not have access to the target Data Station. Another reason to do only
stand-alone validation may be that the overhead of doing calls to the Data Station over the network is too high.

#### XML namespaces

When referring to XML element or attribute names or attribute values that have a prefix (such as `dcterms:identifier`)
an element in a certain namespace is intended. The table below lists the mapping from prefix to namespace. In the actual
document, the namespace may be bound to a different prefix, or be the default namespace.

| Prefix    | Namespace URI                                                    | Namespace documentation                                                 |

Exact names are specified in `code` style. The capitalization of those names must be exactly as specified, unless it is
explicitly stated that the name is case-insensitive. If the name is a file path it is relative to the bag base
directory.


Glossary
--------
This section defines a number of terms that may be useful when discussing this specification. Several of these terms are
used in the [Requirements](#requirements) section of this document. Where terms are used in the definitions of other
terms, they are printed in *italics*.

* **bag**: a data package conforming to the [BagIt]{:target=_blank} specifications.

* **bag-ID**: a [urn:uuid] given to every deposit upon delivery to DANS. The bag-ID of the first version of a dataset is also known as the *sword token*.

* **(version N) DANS-bag**: a *bag* that also conforms to (version N) of the DANS BagIt Profile specifications.

* **DANS Data Station**: the publishing and archiving service of DANS for datasets

* **Data-Station-User-Account**: the account of the *depositor* transferring deposits to DANS

* **dataset**: an information package containing data and metadata published in a *DANS Data Station*. 
  A dataset may have multiple versions.

* **deposit**: a package containing data and metadata sent to DANS by the *depositor* to create a new dataset or dataset version.

* **depositor**: the agent sending data to DANS for publishing in a *DANS Data Station*. This term corresponds to the
  Producer in the [OAIS Reference Model]{:target=_blank}.

* **deaccessioned version**: a dataset that is present in a *DANS Data Station*, but no longer disseminated. To the external user the
  dataset version appears to be deleted, only a tombstone remains.

* **update-deposit**: a *deposit* that is intended to create a new version of an existing *dataset*.

* **version-bag-ID**: a *bag-ID* that references a *version* of a *dataset*. If the *dataset* consists of several
  *versions*, the DOI resolves to the most recent of those *version*<hidden>s. All versions of one dataset have the same *sword token*.

* **sword token**: a [urn:uuid]{:target=_blank} given to first version DEPOSIT bags upon submission through the Sword Service. 
  This UUID is used when depositing an *update-deposit* and to identify all versions of one dataset. 

Requirements
------------

### 1 BagIt related

#### 1.1 Validity

1. The bag MUST be `VALID` according to the [BagIt]{:target=_blank} specifications v1.0 (RFC 8493).

#### 1.2 `bag-info.txt`

1. The bag MUST contain a `bag-info.txt` file.

2. (a) The `bag-info.txt` file MUST contain exactly one element called `Created`. (b) It MUST have a timestamp value
   in [ISO 8601]{:target=_blank} format, including the time zone and a millisecond precision time part. (c) The values
   in the `Created` timestamps SHOULD reflect the correct order of the versions.

3. The `bag-info.txt` file MAY contain at most one element called `Is-Version-Of` with a
   [urn:uuid]{:target=_blank}-value.

4. (a) The `bag-info.txt` file MAY contain at most one element called `Has-Organizational-Identifier`. The value of this 
   element MUST start with a client specific prefix agreed between the client and DANS. If there already exists 
   a dataset in the targeted Data Station with the same value in the field `dansOtherId` then Is-Version-Of as described 
   in 1.2.5 <!-- TODO: check numbering --> MUST be specified to indicate that this deposit is an update of that dataset. 
   (b) If this `Has-Organizational-Identifier` is given, at most one `Has-Organizational-Identifier-Version` MAY be present, 
   containing the version number.

#### 1.3 Manifests

1. If the bag has only one payload manifest it MUST NOT use the MD5 algorithm. It MAY have an MD5 payload manifest in 
   addition to other payload manifests.

### 2 Structural requirements

1. The bag MUST have a tag-directory called `metadata` (one word, lowercase letters) directly under the bag base
   directory.

2. The `metadata` directory MUST contain the files: (a) `metadata/dataset.xml` and (b) `metadata/files.xml`. (c) **(MIGRATION)**
   It MAY contain the files `metadata/amd.xml`, `metadata/emd.xml`, `metadata/provenance.xml`, `metadata/depositor-info/agreements.xml`. 
   (agreements.xml contains information about agreements between the depositor and DANS. Among other things it specifies the existence of personal data within the files in `data`.).

3. **(MIGRATION)** The `metadata` directory MAY contain a directory `original` containing a `dataset.xml` and a `files.xml`,
   representing the original deposit

4. The `metadata` directory MUST NOT contain any other files or directories.

5. Files in the `data` directory MUST NOT have filepaths that include the following characters: `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`
   , `<`, `>`, `|`, `;`, `#`.

#### 2.6 `original-filepaths.txt`

1. A DANS bag MAY contain a file `original-filepaths.txt` in the root of the bag in UTF-8 encoding.

2. It MUST be formatted as `<physical-bag-relative-path><whitespace><original-bag-relative-path>`.
    * `<physical-bag-relative-path>` MUST NOT contain whitespace.
    * `<physical-bag-relative-path>` MUST correspond one-to-one to an existing payload file.
    * `<original-bag-relative-path>` MUST correspond one-to-one to a `filepath` attribute in the `file` elements in
      the `files.xml`.

### 3 Metadata requirements

#### 3.1 `metadata/dataset.xml`

1. The file `metadata/dataset.xml` MUST adhere to [DANS dataset metadata schema]{:target=_blank}.

2. The file `metadata/dataset.xml` MUST have at least one `dcterms:license` element as a child of the
   `dcmiMetadata` element. This element MUST have the attribute `xsi:type="dcterms:URI"`, and the element text MUST be one
   of the [URIs of approved licenses]{:target=_blank}.

3. The file `metadata/dataset.xml` MAY contain one or
   more `dcterms:identifier` elements with an attribute `xsi:type="id-type:DOI"`. The text of this element MUST be a
   syntactically valid [DOI]{:target=_blank} identifier which SHOULD be resolvable.

4. Any `dcx-dai:<scheme>` elements (i.e. DAI, ISNI or ORCID) MUST contain an identifier that complies with the syntaxis
   for the selected identifier scheme URI.

5. Any `gml:postList` elements nested in `gml:Polygon` elements:

    * MUST have an even number of values.
    * MUST have at least three different pairs of values, each of which describes one point.
    * MUST start and end with the same pair of values.

6. If a `gml:MultiSurface` is used, all nested `gml:Polygon` MUST have the same `srsName` attribute.

7. Any `gml:Point`, `gml:lowerCorner` and `gml:upperCorner` elements MUST have at least two values. These values MUST be
   numeric. In case of RD (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992) the values MUST be within the valid range.

8. Any `dc:identifier` or `dcterms:identifier` element with `xsi:type="id-type:ARCHIS-ZAAK-IDENTIFICATIE`
   MUST have a value of 10 or fewer characters.

9. All URLs used in `metadata/dataset.xml` MUST be valid URLs with protocol http or https.

10. The file `metadata/dataset.xml` MUST have a rights holder, either **(DEPOSIT)** in `<dcterms:rightsHolder>` or **(MIGRATION)** as an author with
    role `RightsHolder`.

#### 3.2 `metadata/files.xml`

1. The file `metadata/files.xml` MUST adhere to [DANS bag file metadata schema]{:target=_blank}.

2. Each `file` element's `filepath` attribute MUST contain the bag local path to the payload file described. When an 
   `original-filepaths.txt` exists, rule 2.7.2<!-- TODO: check numbering --> applies. Directories and non-payload files MUST NOT be described by a `file` element.

3. There MUST NOT be more than one `file` element corresponding to a payload file and every payload file MUST be
   described by a `file` element.

#### 3.3 **(MIGRATION)** migration files in `metadata` folder

1. **(MIGRATION)** The file `metadata/depositor-info/agreements.xml` MUST adhere to [DANS deposit agreement metadata]{:target=_blank}.

2. **(MIGRATION)** The file `metadata/amd.xml` is REQUIRED and MUST adhere to [DANS administrative metadata]{:target=_blank}.

3. **(MIGRATION)** The file `metadata/emd.xml` is optional. If it is present it MUST adhere to
   [DANS EASY metadata schema]{:target=_blank}.

4. **(MIGRATION)** The file `metadata/provenance.xml` is optional. If it is present it MUST adhere
   to [DANS provenance metadata schema]{:target=_blank}.

### 4 Dataset update requirements

1. If `bag-info.txt` contains the element `Is-Version-Of` the UUID in its value MUST be a Sword Token 
   in the target Data Station. This SHOULD the Sword Token of a dataset deposited by the same user account.

2. If `bag-info.txt` contains the element `Is-Version-Of`, it MAY also contain an element On-Behalf-Of 
   with an existing Data Station user id. This account MUST have edit rights on the target dataset.
